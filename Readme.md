# Project Title: DSTS Analysis

## Description
This repository contains the code for data science analysis and machine learning tasks on premises (\`onpremises.ipynb\`) and on cloud (\`oncloud.ipynb\`). These notebooks demonstrate various techniques such as data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.

## Files
- \`onpremises.ipynb\`: Code for local (on-premises) data processing and model training.
- \`oncloud.ipynb\`: Code for cloud-based data processing and model training using Amazon SageMaker.
- \`requirements.txt\`: List of dependencies needed to run the notebooks.

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
   \`\`\`bash
   git clone [<repository-link>](https://github.com/Hardik28-DS/dsts.git)
   \`\`\`

2. Navigate to the directory and install dependencies:
   \`\`\`bash
   cd DSTS
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   \`\`\`

3. Open and run the notebooks in a Jupyter environment:
   - \`onpremises.ipynb\` for local processing.
   - \`oncloud.ipynb\` for cloud-based processing on SageMaker.

## Expected Output
The notebooks perform data preprocessing, training of machine learning models, and evaluation of their performance. Outputs include confusion matrices, ROC curves, and performance metrics such as sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy.
